# Repositorio de trabajos de grado
##### _Ingeniería Civil en Computación e Informática_

This is a project created with the intention of being used as a repository for the degree works of the students of my career. It uses a variety of technologies, including Next.js, AWS S3, Planetscale, and Prisma, to create a functional web application.

The goals of this project are to demonstrate my understanding of modern web development technologies and practices, and to create a useful tool for my college community.
